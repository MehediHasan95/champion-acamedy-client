In creating this project, I used MERN stack technology. This is a learning website. Where students can buy classes with their favorite teachers. An instructor can add any classes related to their course. Admins can change the user's role and delete it. Also, admins can approve or deny any instructor classes.

## Features

- Login or register and connect with the Google authentication system.
- Students can see all available classes and instructor lists.
- Students cannot add to cart without logging in. And it doesn't allow for admins and instructors.
- Instructors can add their related classes. And wait for admin approval.
- Admins can change the user's role and approve or deny any instructor classes.

## Technologies:

React JS - React Router - React Hook Form - Axios - Firebase - JWT - React Query - Node JS - Express JS - MongoDB - Stripe.
